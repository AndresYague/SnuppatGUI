This is the first version of a GUI for Snuppat output

Most of the GUI is self explanatory or can be experimented upon. However, it
is useful to note some quirks of the "Add/Remove Element" dialogue box.
First, both elemental and isotopical abundances can be requested in the box.
That is, one could be interested in the iron element (fe should be written in
the box) or the iron 56 isotope (fe56 should be written in the box). Both can
be displayed simultaneously.

Additionally, there are some special names:
* p1 <- Protium
* d2 <- Deuterium
* h <- Hydrogen
* n1, neut <- Neutrons
* effc13 <- Effective C13 (XC13 - XN14*13/14)
